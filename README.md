Front-End Technical Assignment –
Embeddable Chat Widget
Overview
This challenge assesses your ability to design and implement a modern front-end system for
an embeddable chat widget using React, TypeScript, and building an NPM package,
while considering deployment and minimal code integration. You will be building a Chat
Widget Package that can be easily integrated into any website to provide real-time chat
support.
Background
Chat widgets are essential tools for customer engagement and support. The goal is to create
a self-contained React component package that website owners can install and deploy with
minimal code.
Your task is to design and build an npm package for a chat widget, including:
●
Creating an embeddable React component.
●
Packaging and publishing the component as an npm package.
●
Providing clear instructions for installation and deployment.
Requirements

1. Tech Stack
   ●
   Frontend: React + TypeScript
   ●
   Packaging: NPM
   ●
   Design: Follow the design on our website: https://www.eloquentai.co/ Use any
   component library or custom styling; prioritize clarity and UX.
2. Core Features
   Chat Widget
   ●
   A visually appealing chat widget component following Eloquent AI style.
   ●
   Ability to open and close the chat window.
   ●
   Basic chat interaction with an LLM of your choosing.
   ●
   Clear indication of online/offline status (mocked for this assignment).
   ●
   Display a clear and visually appealing banner near the input field to indicate when the
   service is in maintenance mode (mocked for this assignment). While in maintenance
   mode, users should be prevented from sending messages.
   NPM Package
   ●
   Create a distributable npm package.
   ●
   Provide clear installation and usage instructions in the README.
   ●
   Ensure the package is easily installable via
   `
npm install`
   .
   Embeddability
   ●
   Design the widget to be easily embeddable with a as little code as possible. Take
   inspiration from chatbase.co or intercom.com.
   ●
   Consider how it will interact with the host website’s styles and scripts.
3. Bonus Features (Optional but Impressive)
   ●
   Mock user authentication or identification.
   ●
   Simple local persistence for chat messages (e.g., use localStorage).
   ●
   Customizable appearance via props (colors, icons, etc.).
   ●
   Basic handling of user input and message sending (mocked).
   Evaluation Criteria
   Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:
4. Code Quality & Best Practices
   ●
   Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
   ●
   Proper use of TypeScript best practices.
   ●
   Effective use of React components.
5. NPM Packaging
   ●
   Properly configured `package.json`
   .
   ●
   Clear and concise README with usage instructions.
   ●
   Easy installation and usage of the npm package.
6. UI/UX
   ●
   ●
   Usability of the chat widget.
   Smooth user experience, including responsiveness.
7. Embeddability & Deployment
   ●
   Ease of embedding the widget with minimal code.
   ●
   Consideration of potential conflicts with host website styles.
   Submission Guidelines
   ●
   Share your GitHub repository with clear README instructions on how to:
   ○
   Build and test the React component.
   ○
   Package and publish the npm package locally.
